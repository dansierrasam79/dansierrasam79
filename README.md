- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @dansierrasam79, working at a startup in Bangalore, as a Content Specialist. So, why open such a GitHub account, you might ask?
- After obtaining my B.S in Computer Science from University of the People, adding the code written to a space other than Google Drive was necessary. GitHub is such a place. 
- So, even if I'm not collaborating with anyone or working on any development projects currently, I'm just going to use GitHub for the reason that most other people do - store their code for whatever purpose.
- In the hope that someone would benefit from the code that I have written! Particularly beginners! Better still, if someone is interested in my work!
Thanks for dropping by!
