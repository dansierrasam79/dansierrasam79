- 👋 Hey, I'm focused on building scripting skills ranging from dumb automation, data analytics, data science and artificial intelligence. You'll find practice examples of various tools used beginning from Excel (with VBA & Office Scripts), Google Sheets (Apps Scripts), Windows PowerShell, Python (Pandas, NumPy), SQL and R for the same. More to come in the next 3-6 months... vibe coding ALL THE WAY! :)
