- ðŸ‘‹ Hey, back to being a student once more! Have been working on a few Web3 projects using JavaScript and Solidity along with writing some serious Python code for my MS. Even if I generally specialize in content writing and curriculum design. Pursuing my Master's in Computer Science and exploring Rust's syntax and inner workings in the coming months is the main focus. Apart from exploring appropriate employment opportunities!
